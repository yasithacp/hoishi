                                <p class="desc-accordion">No. Network equipment manufacturers (OEM’s) do not require that you use only name-brand optics.
                                    The Federal Trade Commission’s Magnuson-Moss Act/Tie-in Sales Act protects consumers from the restriction that only OEM products or services can be purchased or used in order to keep a warranty valid.

                                <p class="desc-accordion">In most cases, we are able to supply optics for even small, less well-known brands of network equipment. If we don’t already offer a particular brand, we can often code parts if supplied with a sample optic. If you don’t see your brand listed, just send us a request and we will get back to you.</p>

                                    popular optics in stock, ready to ship. However, some of the higher-value and specialized optics have a short lead-time, which we will let you know ahead of time before you place your order.</p>
