Buyers pay the shipping fees for sending any product back to us, and we pay the shipping fees for resending repaired or replaced items to buyers. The warranty is voided when damage is caused by improper handling or neglect, an outside force beyond the control of Hoishi occurs (flooding, fire, civil unrest etc.) or if any repair or opening of the product is undertaken by the dealer or end-user.</p>
