                        <p class="des-shop-page">We understand the challenge of network expansion and upgrade. Purchasing vendor branded optical transceivers and cables can take up a large portion of your technology budget. We can guarantee 100% compatibility at a fraction of the cost against leading vendor branded parts. Products are tested in the target system prior to shipping. We usually ship within 24 hours of purchase order receipt. Included is a limited lifetime warranty.</p>
                        <P class="des-shop-page">Vendor branded optical transceivers & cables are expensive and are not made by the vendors themselves; instead they use contract manufacturers to build, assemble and package industry standard parts for them. Why spend 80%+ more when you can purchase direct from Hoishi?</P>
