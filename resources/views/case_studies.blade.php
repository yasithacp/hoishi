                        <p class="des-shop-page">The components of X2 DWDM are short in the market place and many factories do not produce them any more, so the lead-time is very long, sometimes months and the price is high.</p>
                        <p class="des-shop-page">Hoishi’s solution was to recommend to the end-user to use X2 to SFP+ converter for the requirement. This way the customer can use the more common SFP+ format that many companies hold the components for.  Meaning a fast turn around and lower total cost.</p>
                        <p class="des-shop-page">DWDM-10GSFP-XXX is approximately 4x the price of the X2 to SFP+ convertor. Lead-time is within 3-4 days.</p>
                        <p class="des-shop-page">X2 to SFP+ converter + DWDM-10GSFP-XXXX compared with DWDM-X2-XXXX not only yields significant cost saving but also allows easier upgrade options as the SFP+ modules can be used in alternate switches in the future.</p>
